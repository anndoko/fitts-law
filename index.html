    <!-- Intro -->
    <section id="intro">
      <h2 class="heading">What Is Fitts' Law?</h2>
      <p>
        Fitts's Law is one of the cornerstones of HCI research. In 1954, Fitts described the relationship between the target distance, width, and time needed for a target acquisition task. The distance to a target, a button for example, and its size determine the time required to move a pointing device to the target -- <b>“the closer and larger a target is, the faster it is to click on that target.”</b> This later became known as <b>"Fitts's law."</b>

      <h2 class="heading">Fitts' Law Experiment</h2>
      <p>
        The original investigation consisted of four experiments: two reciprocal tapping tasks, a disc transfer task, and a pin transfer task. In one of the original experiments -- reciprocal tapping task, participants were tasked to move a stylus back and forth between two plates as quickly as possible and tapped the plates at their centers. This arrangement is called <b>"the Fitts’ Paradigm."</b>

      <h3>Interactive Fitts' Law Tests</h3>
      <p>
        Below is a similar, web-based interactive tool for you to experiment. The tool, along with the visualization, aims to support your learning of Fitts' Law.
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <b>sizes</b> of targets and the <b>distance</b> between them vary in each test.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Move your cursor back and forth from non-clickable target to clickable target.</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Clickable object looks like this:
                <div class="ex-clickable"></div>
              </li>
              <li>Not-clickable object looks like this:
                <div class="ex-not-clickable"></div>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Each test requires you to finish <b>10 clicks</b>. You will be presented with the next test as the requirement is made.</li>
          <li>It is worth noting that “the roles of width and height would reverse if the movement is vertical” Click the <b>"Reverse"</b> button to switch to a different layout.
            <div><button class="ex-reverse">Reverse</button></div>
          </li>
          <li>A data point will be collected and shown on the scatter diagram (see the <a href="#result-vis-title">"Test Data Visualization"</a> section) as a dot every time you successfully click the target.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <div class="warn">
        <div class="text-center">⚠️</div>
        <i>Using user-generated data points without a controlled and formal test setup is one limitation of this tool. Please note that this tool is designed only for educative and illustrative purpose.</i>
      </div>

      <!-- Interaction -->
      <div class="test-area">
        <div id="interaction"></div>
        <button id="reverse" class="button">Reverse</button>
      </div>

      <h3 id="result-vis-title">Test Data Visualization</h3>
      <p>
        If you tried the interactive tool above, the data of all your clicks would go into the scatter plot here.
      </p>
      <div id="result-vis"></div>
    </section>
    <!-- Visualization -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="heading">Fitts' Law Visualization</h2>
      <p>
        Did you have fun playing with the experiment? (It is okay if you do not want to try it!) Let's take a look at this visualization using an existing dataset!
      </p>
      <h3>Dataset</h3>
      <p>
        In a controlled experiment conducted by Ken Goldberg at UC Berkeley, the research team collected a total of 22,540 timing measurements. <a href="http://automation.berkeley.edu/fitts-dataset/" target="_blank">The dataset</a> has been cleaned up, keeping only timing measurements for cases where the subject successfully clicks on all presented targets within a "reasonable" time period. Cases where subjects were distracted or decided not to complete the experiment were taken out from the dataset. After cleaning, the dataset contains 16,170 valid timing measurements.
      </p>
      <img width="90%" src="img/dataset.png" alt="A screeshot of the dataset that is used for our visualization"/>
      <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
      <p>
        This scatter plot is created using the dataset mentioned above. Each circle represent a data point, which is mapped according to the <b>"Index of Difficulty"</b> and <b>"Movement time."</b> Can you spot the pattern here?
      </p>
      <div id="data-vis"></div>
      <p>
        Again, the visualization demonstrates the key idea of Fitts' Law: It takes more time to click a target with higher index of difficulty (e.g., an object that is either far away and/or small). The pattern, as shown in the visualization, also fits typical <b>Fitts' regression model</b>.
