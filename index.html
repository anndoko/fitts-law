      <h1>What Is Fitts' Law?</h1>
      <p>
        The idea of Fitts’ Law is that the distance to a target, a button for example, and its size determine the time required to move a pointing device. to the target -- “the closer and larger a target is, the faster it is to click on that target.”

      <h2>Fitts' Law Visualization</h2>
      <p>
        Did you have fun playing with the buttons? Now let's take a look at this visualization using an existing dataset.
      </p>
      <div id="data-vis">

      </div>
      <p>
        In a controlled experiment conducted by Ken Goldberg at UC Berkeley, the research team collected a total of 22,540 timing measurements. The dataset has been cleaned up, keeping only timing measurements for cases where the subject successfully clicks on all presented targets within a "reasonable" time period. Cases where subjects were distracted or decided not to complete the experiment were taken out from the dataset. After cleaning, the dataset contains 16,170 valid timing measurements.

            <ul>
              <li>The presence of visual cues on the target</li>
              <li>The size of the target</li>
              <li>The look-and-feel of the target</li>
              <li>The distance to the target</li>
              <li>The cognitive load of the user</li>
              <li>The user’s existing mental model</li>
